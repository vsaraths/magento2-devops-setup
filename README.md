Multi-Cloud Magento 2 Setup
This project demonstrates a multi-cloud environment setup for deploying Magento 2 using AWS and DigitalOcean. The goal is to install and configure Magento 2, including all the necessary components such as PHP, MySQL, NGINX, Elasticsearch, Redis, and Varnish, across multiple cloud platforms to provide a scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure.

Overview
This project is designed to create a Magento 2 environment spread across AWS an cloud platform. It demonstrates the use of essential services and tools for deploying and managing a Magento 2 store at scale, such as NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Varnish, and PHP.

The goal is to achieve redundancy, scalability, and fault tolerance by distributing services across multiple cloud providers and configurations. This setup also ensures the system stays within AWS Free Tier limits.

This project demonstrates the installation and configuration of Magento 2 in a multi-cloud environment using AWS Free Tier. The setup includes:

Magento 2 with Sample Data
NGINX as the web server
PHP 8.1 with PHP-FPM
MySQL 8 as the database
Elasticsearch for search functionality
Redis for caching and sessions
Varnish for full-page caching
PHPMyAdmin for database management
HTTPS with a self-signed certificate

The project is distributed across multiple AWS instances to handle resource constraints (1 GB RAM per instance).

Technologies Used

Cloud Provider: AWS (Free Tier)
Operating System: Debian 11
Web Server: NGINX
Database: MySQL 8
Search Engine: Elasticsearch
Caching: Redis, Varnish
PHP: PHP 8.1 with PHP-FPM
Automation: Bash Scripts
Version Control: Git/GitHub
